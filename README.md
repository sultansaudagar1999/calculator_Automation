📄 Calculator Automation Testing Project
🚀 Project Overview
This project automates the testing of a calculator web application using Java, Selenium, TestNG, and Extent Reports. The framework is designed to perform:

Functional Testing

UI Component Testing

Regression Testing

Cross-Browser Testing

End-to-End Integration Testing

🛠️ Technology Stack
Java 17

Selenium 4.21.0

TestNG

Maven

Extent Reports

WebDriverManager (automatic driver management)

Browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox

✅ Key Features
🚀 Supports cross-browser testing using TestNG parameters.

✅ Generates Extent Reports with screenshots on failure.

⚙️ Batch file (run.bat) for easy test execution.

📂 Supports parallel execution using CrossBrowser.xml.

📋 Well-organized test cases covering functional, UI, and regression flows.

🧪 Test Suites
Suite Name	      Purpose
Master.xml	      Full execution: Functional, UI, Regression
CrossBrowser.xml	Parallel cross-browser testing
Functional.xml	  Functional tests only
Regression.xml	  Regression tests only

💻 How to Run the Tests
1️⃣ Run All Tests:
mvn test

2️⃣ Run Cross-Browser Tests:
mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=CrossBrowser.xml

3️⃣ Run via Batch File:
run.bat

📊 Reporting
Extent Reports are generated in the reports folder automatically after test execution.

Screenshots of failed tests are saved in the screenshots folder.

The report will auto-open upon completion.

🔧 Prerequisites
Java 17+
